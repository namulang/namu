WORLD, <br/>The new programming language.
=======================================

    ! Please be advised that World can't support below features now. we're working in progress.

### What's this?
World is a interpreter and visual IDE for new programming language, World language.
it has following main features.

> * anchor-way development: You can get "so immediately" feedbacks whenever you codes.
        there is no any a "compile" thing. if you're writing down your codes, means that 
        you're in debugging at the same time.
>
> 
> * Touch the instances: Basically, in order to make your function or class with World, 
        you should write somethings as a text. like other launguages.
        But, because of lack of compling, you always are in a middle of runtime envrionment
        whenever you codes your software. You can see which interactions are made of between
        classes and functions in visualized 3d graphics. 
        Visualization can get strong points that make you focus the whole picture of your
        software.
>
> * ModuleStore: Module is simply plug-in. mostly based on c++. you download packs
        which you want anytime.
>
> * Easy to use: we hope who aren't a programmer could join us to make a program with
        World. its IDE will be served as a classic GAME. 
        pixel art, particle effects, retro sound fx, RPGistic UI, Worldmap, quest and archivement.


### Dev. Environment
> * build: cmake&make, clang, python(for some scripts) + bison
> * issue-tracker: github project
> * unit-test: gtest
> * road-map: refer http://free-timeline.com/?shared=10593
> * os: linux, macos, windows + minGW


### How to Start
#### Let's Build

Preparing: to build World, following softwares will be needed.
            
    python 3.+, cmake, make, and clang

if you're trying on windows, then it's recommended to install minGW and above softwares.

Then, just enter:
        
    python ./build/builder.py dbg

All script you need for doing something on World is just at builder.py.

For more information, try "builder.py help"

#### Let's make something with World!
    
    Oh,... Ummmm. Not yet.
