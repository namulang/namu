Namu, <br/>The new programming language.
=======================================

    ! Please be advised that 'namu' can't support below features now. we're working in progress.

### What's this?
Namu is a interpreter and visual IDE for new programming language, namu language.
it has following main features.

> * anchor-way development: You can get "so immediately" feedbacks whenever you codes.
        there is no any a "compile" thing. if you're writing down your codes, means that
        you're in debugging at the same time.
>
>
> * Touch the instances: Basically, in order to make your function or class with 'namu',
        you should write somethings as a text. like other launguages.
        But, because of lack of compling, you always are in a middle of runtime envrionment
        whenever you codes your software. You can see which interactions are made of between
        classes and functions in visualized 3d graphics.
        Visualization can get strong points that make you focus the whole picture of your
        software.
>
> * ModuleStore: Module is simply plug-in. mostly based on c++. you download packs
        which you want anytime.
>
> * Easy to use: we hope who aren't a programmer could join us to make a program with
        namu. its IDE will be served as a classic GAME.
        pixel art, particle effects, retro sound fx, RPGistic UI, Worldmap, quest and archivement.


### Dev. Environment
> * build: cmake&make, clang, python(for some scripts) + bison
> * issue-tracker: github project
> * unit-test: gtest
> * road-map: refer http://free-timeline.com/?shared=10593
> * os: linux, macos, windows + WSL(ubuntu)


### How to Start
#### Let's Build

Preparing: to build 'namu', following softwares will be needed.

    python 3.+, cmake, make, and clang

if you're trying on windows, then it's recommended to use WSL and above softwares.

Then, just enter:

    python ./build/builder.py dbg

All script you need for doing something on 'namu' is just at builder.py.

For more information, try "builder.py help"

#### Let's make something with Namu!

    Oh,... Ummmm. Not yet.
