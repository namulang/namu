## v0.2.7 Mana Update
released on 06-15 2024
build#957

* apply code integration tools.
    1. clang-tidy, clang-format.
    add compiler options like '-Wextra', 'Wpedantic' to warn defect codes.

    2. generate language server file for LSP.

    values from rich obj. for instance,
        NM_E("type name of obj is %s, value 'name' of std::string is %s", objptr->getType().getName().c_str(), name.c_str())

    Now, richLog converts automatically depends on its dynamic type.
    if you pass an object class, richLog will convert and get const char* from its type name.
    if you pass an std::string class, it'll get const char* by running 'it.c_str()' instead of you.
    and it can handle nevertheless you put a pointer/reference type of T!
    for instance,
        NM_E("type name of obj is %s, value 'name' of std::string is %s", objptr, name); // very intuitive and code was shorten!

    5. rename genericObj to genericOrigin

    6. make safeGet macro.
    this is like safe-navigation feature of other modern languages.
    this let me implement far consice code.
    e.g.
        // as-is:
        if(nul(context)) return NM_E("context is null"), false;

        canvas& c = context.getCanvas();
        if(nul(c)) return NM_E("canvas is null"), false;

        paint* p = canvas.getPaint();
        if(nul(p)) return NM_E("paint is null"), false;

        brush& b = p->getBrush();
        if(nul(b)) return NM_E("brush is null"), false;
        b.doSomething();

        // to be:
        brush& b = safeGet(context, getCanvas(), getPaint(), getBrush());
        if(nul(b)) return NM_E("brush is null"), false;
        b.doSomething();

* made new bridge API.
    tbridger defines a bridge to a func.
    tbridge is bridgeObj can take bridge instances made with tbridger.
    but if you cares, you can define a baseObj which can bridge funcs with bridger.
    with for previous bridge version, you can't do this. because bridges to func always got attached to
    bridgeObj, not baseObj.

    so code duplication removed by defining a func based on baseFunc with tbridger.

    and tbridger also now can provide API to make a constructor which takes various parameters.
    and tbridger provide making a bridger func to your lambda.

    however, when you define a bridge func to this new bridger API, bridge funcs are stored into static variable.
    please take care of it.

    here is sample codes.

        ```cpp
            struct yourClass2 {};
            struct yourClass {
                yourClass(int n, yourClass2* p) {}

                int say(int n) {
                    return n + 1;
                }
                void fly() {}
                std::string fly(const char* msg) {
                    return std::string(msg);
                }
            };

            tbridger<yourClass>::ctor<int, yourClass2*>()
                .ctor<yourClass>()
                .func("say", &yourClass::say)
                .func<std::string, const char*>("fly", &yourClass::fly)
                .closure<yourClass*, yourClass, int, yourClass2*>("runMyLambda", [&](int n, yourClass2* ptr) -> yourClass* {
                    return new yourClass(n, ptr);
                });
            // now 'tbridger<yourClass>' contains 5 bridge funcs in static memory.

            scope& managedFuncs = tbridger<yourClass>::subs(); // usage-way 1)

            str derivedBaseObj = tbridger<yourClass>::make(new yourClass(0, nullptr)); // usage-way 2)
            derivedBaseObj->isSub<baseObj>() // true.
            str res = derivedBaseObj->run("say", narr{nInt(23)});
            res->cast<nint>(); // 24

            str arg2 = tbridger<yourClass2>::ctor().make(new yourClass2());
            str res = derivedBaseObj->run("runMyLambda", narr{nInt(0), *args2})
            // res is new tbridge<yourClass> instance.
        ```

* origin object has been added.
    origin shouldn't be visible to most places. so when you pass, handle origin object,
    you treat it just as a baseObj. there is no specific API which is only available
    to origin class, not baseObj.

* fix minor memory leak issues.

* add reldbg build mode.
    it's code has been optimized out just like rel mode, but still includes debug info.

* logging readability improved.
    1. mostly NM_TAG value was redundant. so removed.
    add some padding to align values.

    2. when AST structure display, prints pointer address by representing 4 hex digit.

    3. on verification, prints what it verifies, step by step.

* code refactoring to get better class structure.
    * make defVarExpr to reduce code duplication between defPropExpr and defAssignExpr.

    * remove code duplication between whileExpr, forExpr.

    * delete redundant classes.

    * add 'worker' as common class of 'verifier, interpreter, visitor, parser, preEvaluator, starter'.

* add new frame API

* signal catch.
    * when system interrupt raised, it can be catched to our signaler class.
    * before crash app, prints all current running AST structure.

* exception handling.
    * when unexpected 'err' instance found on running one of statements in blockExpr, it'll be judged to an exception.
    * when exception found, leave to errReport, codes keep unwinding. and finally app will stop its doing if there is proper
      handling logic somewhere.
    * native call stack can be shown.

* enhanced graphVisitor
    * show more text in color.
    * show more info to debug and know in detail.
    * show each node's address in 4 hex digit. very useful when you debug.

* performance optimization
    * add 'mockNode'
    this is literally doesn't contains copied object info but have only origin object info.
    but when this mockNode placed on verification, verifier regards that this is something cloned by origin object.
    so it think this as complete object. and that's what I want.
    in consequences, I don't copy each nodes and member variables for verification.

* new syntax, 'break'.

* new syntax, 'overloading'.
    function overloading is now functional.
    when you call a function and it could be one of possible functions in your context,
    verification will calculate affinity of each possible calls and score it.
    I named it as 'match'.
    each match represents function-call against all available functions in current frame.
    there are 4 kind of matches now.

        EXACT_MATCH:        this means perfect score match. this is probably what user wants.
        NUMERIC_MATCH:      to call this function, some of user's parameter should numeric
                            implicit cast. numeric implicit cast has slightly high priority to
                            usual cast.
        IMPLICIT_MATCH:     to call this func, some of user's paremeter should usual cast.
                            mostly, it would be upcasting. (e.g. DerivedClass --> SuperClass)
        NO_MATCH:           with implicit casting, there is no way to be enough to call this func.
                            explicit casting may required.

    and each match also has calling score(== lv). the lower the higher priority.
    each score can easily be calculated. it's how far distance does it to top of the current frame.

* new syntax, ': ;'.
    it's inline empty block.

* remove old syntax, 'elif'
    use 'else if' instead.

## v0.01a Dust Update build# 9444
it was 02-25 2016.
Dust is the name of an update used by the 'Node Engine' project that was origin of the 'world language'.
'NodeEngine' is a result of consideration how to visualize programming elements and let users express and orgranize their thoughts in visual. Unfortunately, as a result of deliberation, I had to accept not to release to public because it's not enough useful to what I intended to be.

it has been developed by myself for quite a while, so even if it's not released officially I want to keep it below as records.
