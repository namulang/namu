# Changelogs
## v0.2.9 Mana Update
released on 02-07 2024
build#1162

### language updates

\+ shorten-property-definition grammar changes.
Previously, `@` was used, but now it is changed to `'`. The function itself is the same.
```nm
def Person
age := 12

main() void
    Person'
    person.age = 39
```
It is more intuitive because it resembles the symbols used in mathematics.

\+ String template has been added.
Use `$identifier` or `${expression}`.
```nm
// Previous:
print("your name is " + name + " and double of your age is " + (age * 2) as str)
// Changed:
print("your name is $name and double of your age is ${age * 2}")
```

\+ String iterators now work based on codepoints. Namu language used UTF-8 as the base, but
since the existing strings always advanced by 1 byte in the case of iterators, it could not
properly output multibyte Unicode.
From now on, this has been improved so that the iterators advance/retreat only based on codepoint.
```nm
src := "abcd🏁efg" # There is a multibyte Unicode flag in the middle.
print(src[2]) # c
print(src[5]) # e
print(src[4]) # 🏁

# In the case of the flag above, `0xf0 0x9f 0x8f 0x81` is a total of 4 bytes,
# but `len()` considers it as 1.
print(src.len()) # 8
```

\+ `abstract function` can now be defined. An abstract function is a function definition statement
that does not have a function implementation (body).
This definition can be used as a function type or as an interface that must be filled in a derived
class.
```nm
foo(input int) int # abstract function
# no body here.
```

\+ A nested function is added.
A nested function means a function defined within a function.
A nested function has the characteristic of capturing the scope when defined.
```nm
main() int
    name := "kniz"
    hello(who str) str
        msg := "$who like Nintendo."
        ret "$name: $msg" # Capture the local variable `msg`.
                          # A variable that has been captured once has no effect even if its
                          # value changes later.
    name = "charles"
    print(hello("I")) # kniz: I like Nintendo.
```

If you return a nested function, it becomes a `closure`, which is commonly referred to in other languages.

```nm
foo(input int) int: 0
makeClosure(n int) foo # The return type is a function.
    ret if n >= 0
        # This nested function captures the previously defined `n`.
        multiply(input int) int: input * n
    else
        # This nested function captures the previously defined `n`.
        subtract(input int) int: input - n

main() int
    sub := makeClosure(-5) # This is a function that does `input + 5`.
    multi := makeClosure(5) # This is a function that does `input * 5`.
    multi(3) + sub(3) # 15 + 8 --> 23
```

\+ Lambda syntax is added.
Lambda is an anonymous function, and can only be defined within a function call expression.
Since it is an anonymous function, the form that only lacks the function name in the existing
function definition is the most consistent form with lambda syntax.
Therefore, it is defined as follows.
```nm
(value value-type) return-type
    stmt1
    stmt2
    ...
```
For example, it becomes like this.
```nm
foo(n int) int
add(foo', input int) int
    ret foo(input)

main() int
    ret add((n int) int # <-- lambda definition in progress.
        n + 3
    , 10) # <-- Be careful about the indentation of `,`.
    # If you abbreviate the above code, it becomes: add((n int) int: n + 3).
```
Lambda's `parameter deduction` and `return-type deduction` will be added in the future.

\+ You can specify an explicit type when defining an assignment.

```nm
foo() student: .... # Assuming that student is a derived object of person.
you person := foo() # you points to a student object, but it is of type person.
```

\+ The structure of `leaf` has been applied to the parser/scanner structure of the latest `core`.

\- Fixed an error that allowed containers with different parameterized types to be converted.

\- Removed an error that allowed `_` to be used at the beginning of an identifier.
If _ is used at the beginning, it should be recognized as a `protected` access modifier, not a name.

\- Removed an issue that prevented octal and hexadecimal numbers from being parsed properly.

\- Removed the issue where `call-complete` could be used on incomplete objects.
```nm
def Person("myName") # <-- You should not use call-complete on incomplete objects.
    ctor(newName str)
    ...
def person("myName") # OK
    ...
```

\- Removed Character type.
Now, even a single character is expressed as a string like python.

```nm
// Previous:
b := 104
b as char == `h`

// Changed:
b := 104
b as str == "h"
```

\- Fixed the error where it was impossible to call directly by receiving a closure like
`getClosure(3)(object)`.

### framework updates

\+ Visitor can now decide whether to revisit or not.

When inheriting Visitor, you can decide with a boolean value.

```cpp
class yourVisitor : public visitor {
    yourVisitor(): visitor(false/*not reentrant*/) {}
};

yourVisotor yours;
yours.setReturnable(true); // Changed to reentrant
```

\+ The submini language was named `seedling`, but it has been changed to `leaf`.
I like it because it is shorter and more intuitive.

\+ Type conversion has been optimized a bit more. It is expected to have a slight performance
advantage.

\+ The return type of `isSub()/isSuper()` has been expanded. Previously, both `isSub()/isSuper()`
were provided as `boolean` types, and were considered true and returned even if they were the same type.
From now on, each function will return one of the three `int`s.
```cpp
constexpr nint NO_RELATION = 0;
constexpr nint SUPER = 1;
constexpr nint SUB = 1;
constexpr nint SAME = 2;
```

\+ Type Convergence has been slightly optimized for speed.

\+ `WHEN` macro has been added.

\+ Sequential unordered multimap is added.
A container that `remembers the insertion order` is added to the STL's unordered multimap.
This will be mainly used to iterate the scope in that order by remembering the insertion order.

\+ All iterators are now bidirectional, so they can also go backwards.

\+ `chain` can now `link()` based on `iter`.

This is a very important feature, playing a key role in `scope` and bringing great extensibility.

For example, previously, you could `link()` based on `chain`. If a new element was added to the
container after `link()`, it would also be included in `chain`.
This problem creates an issue where if a local variable is captured by `closure`, a variable with
the same name would be accessible from `closure` later.
To solve this problem, `link()` should be based on `iter`.

Also, since `iter` can proceed backward, `chain` can be configured to proceed backward only in
some sections.

```cpp
typedef tnchain<std::string, int> chain;
chain m;
m.add("meat", 1);
m.add("banana", 2);
chain m2;
m2.add("apple", 3);
m2.add("banana", 4);
m2.add("pineapple", 5);
chain m3;
m3.add("mango", 6);
m3.add("melon", 7);

// Create a reverse iterator for b2, and link it from there after moving 1 step backwards.
m.link(m2.rbegin() + 1);

// Elements of the container that m has: "meat" -> "banana"
// Elements of m2: "apple" -> "banana" -> "pineapple"
// Elements of m as a chain: "meat" -> "banana" -> "banana" -> "apple"
//                           The reason why "banana" appears twice in a row is because m2 was
//                           linked backwards.
// m2.link(m3.begin() + 1); // Element of m3: "mango" -> "melon"
// Element of m as a chain: "meat" -> "banana" -> "banana" -> "apple" -> "melon"

m2.add("watermelon", 8); // This element is added at the end.
                         // Since m linked from +1 in the reverse direction, this element
                         // is not visible from m's perspective.
m3.add("strawberry", 9); // Since m2 inserted m3 in the forward direction, this element
                         // is also visible from m's perspective.
m.add("pumpkin", 10); // It is added at the end of the container that m has.

// At this point, the elements of m as a chain:
// "meat" -> "banana" -> "pumpkin" -> "banana" -> "apple" -> "melon" -> "strawberry"
```

\+ Rewrote the Type Convergence module by restructuring it further.

\- Fixed an issue where `expander` did not remove the `@expand` function after the generic was evaluated.

\- Optimized by creating a `mockNode` instead of creating and evaluating the actual object in the
`verification` step.

\- Removed memory leaks that occurred during parsing.

\- `getExtra()` is removed from `type`.
Since it is void* in the end, it was not used because it was unstable and annoying to have to do an
unstable type conversion on the user side.

## v0.2.8 Mana Update
released on 08-28 2024
build#1064

### language updates

\+ We now use '#' to represent comments. This makes comments simpler to express.
```namu
def person
    age int # You can write a comment like this.
```

\+ Supports multiline comments.
   Use `##` to indicate the start and end.
   However, be careful with whitespace when ending a multiline comment in the middle of code.
```namu
def Person
    age int ## This is where the multiline comment starts.
The comment is still valid: ##    grade flt # Make sure to put a four spaces before it so
                                            # that they are in the same block.
```

\+ We can now define a custom constructor.
   Specify it with the `ctor` identifier. and omit the return type.
```namu
def Person
    age int
    ctor(): ; # empty block statement.
    ctor(newAge int): age = newAge

main() int
    p1 := Person # ctor() will be called.
    p2 := Person(33) # ctor(int) will be called.
```

\+ An `err` object is added to `builtin`.
   We can now represent an err.

\+ `is` syntax is added.
   returns a bool value indicating whether the given lhs object is compatible with the rhs object.

\+ The `complete-object` syntax is added.
   It is now possible to represent a complete object when defining an object with `def`.
   In the namu language, all properties are represented by convention rules.
   Similarly, if the first letter of an identifier is lowercase, it is treated as a complete object.
```namu
def pERSON # This is a complete object.
   age := 23
main int: pERSON.age # A complete object can be used just like a regular object.
```
   Incomplete objects have their first letter capitalized, and all identifiers must be non-capitalized.

```namu
def Person # This is an incomplete object.
    age := 23
main() int
    ret Person().age # Incomplete objects must be created via constructor.
```

\+ `const` expressions are now added.
   Again, following the philosophy of the NAMU language, we represent this as a convention rule.
   Identifiers of two or more characters and all capitalized letters means `const`.
   However, you cannot use `const` when defining an object.
```namu
def PERSON # Error. There is no point in using const when defining an object.
    ...

def Person
    age := 23
    ctor(newAge int): age = newAge

PERSON := Person(20) # OK, this PERSON is a const.
main() int
    PERSON = Person(40) # ERROR. You can't assign another object to PERSON.
```

\+ `callComplete` syntax is added.
   You can give a specific value when creating a complete object. To use this, when defining the object,
   put any argument list besides of it.
```namu
def person(Teacher(“kniz”)) # using callComplete syntax.
    t teacher
    ctor(newTeacher teacher): t = newTeacher

def Teacher
    ctor(newName str): name = newName
    name str

main int
    ret person.t.name.len() # this is just like, 'ret "kniz".len()'
```

\+ all packs are complete objects by default.

\+ the unary `+` operator is removed.
   it gets in the way of expressing visibility, which comes later, and it's not really needed.

\+ visibility is now added.
   again, following the philosophy of the namu language, this is represented as a convention rule.
   - By default, we don't mark anything otherwise, it means `public`.
   - If you prefix it with `_` at any an identifier, it means `protected`.
   Note that the `_` is not part of the identifier.
```namu
def person
    _age := 38
    foo() void
        # We're accessing age, not _age.
        print("I'm " + age as str + " yo.")
```

You can explicitly represent a func that it is overrided with `+`.
   This is currently meaningless because we have no extension yet,
   but it allows you to explicitly state that a function/property is overrided.
   The order with underscore, which represents the visibility, is irrelevant.
```namu
def student ... # Suppose we expanded from person here.
    _+foo() void # We are stating that we have overridden the "foo() void" function in person.
                # If person didn't have a foo() function, this would be an error.
        print(“ok”)
```

\+ The `end` keyword is added.
   `end` defines an additional block statement after it.
   This causes the block statement to be executed just before the function ends.
   If multiple `end`s are defined in a function, the most recently defined `end` will executed first.
```namu
foo() int
    a := file()
    end
        a.close()      # 1)
    if !a.isOpen()
        b := file()
        end: b.close() # 2)

        # If the function was terminated at this point, the end block statements would be executed
        # in the order 2 -> 1.
```

\+ Adds a function type.
   You can use the name of the function as the function type.
   More detailed usage will be covered in the below `closure` topic.
```namu
def Person
    foo(n int) int: ....
    getClosure() foo # Use the function name as the return type.
        ..??..       # you don't know how to return it yet.
```

\+ closure is added.
   A closure is an assignable function-call that captures the obj scope and arguments.
   This allows for completely first-class-citizen like behavior.
```namu
def Person
    someClosure(n int) int: 0
    foo(n int) int
        ret n + 3
    getClosure() someClosure
        ret foo # OK. foo and someClosure have the same parameters and the same return type.
```

   Implicit casting between function types is not supported.
   This means that you can't pass a function to another function type just because some of the parameters are slightly different.

```namu
def Person
    someClosure(n flt) int: 0 # note that n is now of flt type.
    foo(n int) int: 3
    getClosure() someClosure: foo # Error!
        # Implicit casting is usually triggered when putting an int argument into an flt parameter.
        # and it has worked fine so far.
        #
        # However, when dealing with function types, implicit casting is not allowed for any
        # parameters and return type.
        # So someClosure and foo are completely different types.
```

   Function types also capture obj scope.
   the namu language can expect that you are about to want a closure,
   when you put a function as an argument or return a function to current function scope.
   in that case, namu language automatically makes a closure from a function call instead of you.
   with this feature, we can write code like the following.
```namu
def a
    foo(n int) int: n + 5
def b
    foo(n int) int: n - 2 # as you may know, a.foo and b.foo are same function type.

foo(f a.foo, n int) int
    f(n) # this runs closure. it doesn't care which object a given function belongs to.

main() int
    foo(a.foo, 1) + foo(b.foo, 1) # 6 + -1 ==> 5
```

\+ Supports type convergence.
   Type convergence is the feature to convert and converge a given object to its type when executing code.
   This means that not only objects defined by `def` function as types, but also function parameters,
   properties, and even local variables.
```namu
def Person
    ctor(newAge age) # newAge will eventually be converted to an int.
        age = newAge # even if you don't know what actual type of newAge,
                     # but you can be sure that it's compatible to age.
    age := 25

    foo() age
        val age
        val = age + 5
        val2 val # local variables can also be used as types.
        ret val2
```

   This contributes greatly to the philosophy of the NAMU language, which is to blur the distinction between objects and classes.
   There are only objects and types, not class any longer. and every object has a type.

   Type convergence is handled by the our `expander`, so it doesn't depend on the order of the sequence.
   Look at the code example above again.
   The `ctor` of `Person` defines `age` as a parameter type,
   but `age` is actually defined two lines down in the line,
   so if the interpreter was simply evaluating the code from top to bottom, it would have no choice but to resolve the above code as an error.
   NAMU languages solves this problem easily thanks to expander.

\- Fixed an issue with misreading dedication when expressing some complex lambdas.

\- Fixed an issue that prevented syntax like `value a.b.c` from being used.

\- Fixed an issue where it was possible to define a property even though there was no constructor with no arguments.
```namu
def Person
    ctor(n int) # the constructor has an int parameter.
        ... # doSomething

main() int
    p Person # Error. Because this code should be able to call Person() ctor.
```

### c++ framework updates

\+ Print the four digits of the address value together to aid in debugging.
   This little value, which I've named addrId, is represented as something like `@12d4`.
   It acts like a sort of abbreviated hash value, making it easier to tell which object is at which address.

\+ The tbridger class is now able to express inheritance. Use `extend()` to do so.

\+ `err` can be exported as an exception.
   blockExpr checks whether an exception has been added after eval every line.
   To express err in native environments, inherit from or use `nerr`.

\+ If an error occurs while fetching a pack, leave a detailed log.

\+ Manage parsing, verification, and expanding as states.
   This allows us to clearly express what stage each AST object is in and optimize it accordingly.
   For example, on the first call to subs() for an object in the LINKED state, if it is a complete object,
   `callComplete` will be executed.

\+ Added common construcutor.
   The initialization of an object's properties must be executed every time, no matter what constructor it goes through.
   To manage this efficiently, the common constructor contains common logic that all constructors must execute.
```namu
def Person
    age := 23
    age2 := 24
    age3 := 25
    age4 .....

    ctor(n int): .... # 1)
    ctor(n flt): .... # 2)
    ctor(n char): ... # 3)
        ## If there is no common constructor, then for each constructor 1, 2, and 3, we'll use
            age = 23
            age2 = 24
            age3 = 25
        for each constructor, you would have to have all the above codes. ##
```

\+ Completely improves the design of constructors.
   The traditional prespective was “call constructor == create object”, but this is problematic in the case of inheritance.
   This is because inheritance requires calling multiple constructors.
   The new perspective separates constructor calls and object creation.
   This works well if you only want to call the constructor for an already created object (callComplete, etc.).
   However, objects defined in native, such as bridge objects, are created immediately when the constructor is called.

\+ `tbaseObjOrigin` is added to represent the origin of the native object.
   It's all because of visibility, which doesn't need to be held for each cloned local object.
   So the appropriate place to hold it would be the origin, but we've returned the origin of the native object as a constant so far.
   This means that, using nInt as an example, once nInt's visibility is made public, all nInt objects's visibility will always be public.
   To solve this, there is only one origin object for an nInt by default, but you have the flexibility to point to a cloned origin if needed.
   This job is handled by tbaseObjOrigin.

\+ Changed `has()` function in container to `in()`.
   This is to pair with the `in` keyword.

\+ Parameter information for functions is now managed in ntype.

\+ Added lazyMgdType class to lazily evaluate parameter, ret, to avoid getting stuck in infinite recursion.

\+ `orRet` macro is added.
   If you define a variable with an initial value and it ends up in a null state,
   you may `return` the function or `continue` a loop is very common and leads to a lot of redundant code.
   The `orRet` macro will return the function with the appropriate value if the preceding initial value is determined to be null.
```cpp
// 1 - before:
A* a = getPainter().getBrush().getA();
if(!a)    return false;
// 1 - after:
A* a = getPainter().getBrush().getA() orRet false;


// 2 - before:
while(true) {
    A* a = getA();
    if(!a) continue;
}
// 2 - after:
while(true) {
    A* a = getA() orContinue;
} // note that you need to use curly brackets. when you `orContinue`, it expands to 2 lines.
````

\+ a big improvement to the safe navigation macro.
   Previously, we created and used `safeGet` macro, but it had a few problems.

   - `orRet` required similar behavior to `safeGet`, but `safeGet` is not reusable structure.
     I couldn't combine them into common logic.
   - It was not possible to use `orRet` directly on the result of `safeGet(a, b, c)`.
   - I had to put round brackets around the expr, `a.b.c`, which was kind of ugly.
        e.g. safeGet(a, b, c)
   - If you did a `safeGet(a, b(), c)` and then did another `safeGet` inside `b()`,
     the value would sometimes be twisted.
     This was because `safeGet` holds the value in a global variable instead of storing it in a temporary one.

   The new and improved macro is the `THEN` macro, which solves all of the above problems.
   Because it is designed to be generic so it was easy to create an `orRet` macro reusing it.
   It is also possible to apply `orRet` to the result of using `THEN`.
   Since we used `->*` overloading, which is a suffix operator, we don't need the outer curly brackets.
   Also, since we're returning from function to function,
   we don't need to store the value in a global variable somewhere. usage for it will follow.

```namu
// before:
A* a = safeGet(c, getB(), getA());
if(!a) return false;

// after:
A* a = c THEN(getB()) THEN(getA()) orRet false;
```

   Note that it has all the functionality of safeGet.
   - If null is encountered in the middle of code, the final value will be null.
     during running above codes, the program never crash.
   - If you get a T* in the middle or if you get a T&& or if you get a T or if you get a T&,
     it's all taken care of. Even if it's a pointer. I mean, dereferencing is not necessary.
```namu
// assume that when you call getB(), it returns nullptr of B*.
const int& a = getC()->getB().getAge(); // this will crash your app.

const int& a = getC() THEN(getB()) THEN(getAge()); // this won't crash your app.
nul(a); // true
```

\- Fixed an issue where demangle would not work for templates.

\- Fixed an issue where colors were not changing on windows.

\- No default constructor is created if the user defines a constructor.

\- Fixed an issue where overloading matching would misbehave.

\- Fixed an issue that sometimes caused the error log to be printed twice.

\- Fixed an issue where having an empty block statement would cause a crash.

\- Fixed an issue where `is` could not be used for primitive types.

\- baseFunc is no longer expr.
   The characteristic of expr is that run is executed when you do as().
   The as of a function should be the return value, not the execution of the function.

### etc
\- wasm binary couldn't leave some logs

\+ The 'make install' command is now available in Linux environments. Hooray!

\+ Support for code coverage.
   If you use the `cov` command in builder.py, it will calculate coverage using `llvm-cov` and `lcov`.
   Compute coverage via github action and you can check the result as a badge in the our README.

## v0.2.7 Mana Update
released on 06-15 2024
build#957

* apply code integration tools.
    1. clang-tidy, clang-format.
    add compiler options like '-Wextra', 'Wpedantic' to warn defect codes.

    2. generate language server file for LSP.

    values from rich obj. for instance,
        NM_E("type name of obj is %s, value 'name' of std::string is %s", objptr->getType().getName().c_str(), name.c_str())

    Now, richLog converts automatically depends on its dynamic type.
    if you pass an object class, richLog will convert and get const char* from its type name.
    if you pass an std::string class, it'll get const char* by running 'it.c_str()' instead of you.
    and it can handle nevertheless you put a pointer/reference type of T!
    for instance,
        NM_E("type name of obj is %s, value 'name' of std::string is %s", objptr, name); // very intuitive and code was shorten!

    5. rename genericObj to genericOrigin

    6. make safeGet macro.
    this is like safe-navigation feature of other modern languages.
    this let me implement far consice code.
    e.g.
        // as-is:
        if(nul(context)) return NM_E("context is null"), false;

        canvas& c = context.getCanvas();

        brush& b = p->getBrush();

        if(nul(b)) return NM_E("brush is null"), false;
        b.doSomething();

* made new bridge API.
    tbridger defines a bridge to a func.
    tbridge is bridgeObj can take bridge instances made with tbridger.
    but if you cares, you can define a baseObj which can bridge funcs with bridger.
    with for previous bridge version, you can't do this. because bridges to func always got attached to
    bridgeObj, not baseObj.

    so code duplication removed by defining a func based on baseFunc with tbridger.

    and tbridger also now can provide API to make a constructor which takes various parameters.
    and tbridger provide making a bridger func to your lambda.

    however, when you define a bridge func to this new bridger API, bridge funcs are stored into static variable.
    please take care of it.

    here is sample codes.

        ```cpp
            struct yourClass2 {};
            struct yourClass {
                yourClass(int n, yourClass2* p) {}

                int say(int n) {
                    return n + 1;
                }
                void fly() {}
                std::string fly(const char* msg) {
                    return std::string(msg);
                }
            };

            tbridger<yourClass>::ctor<int, yourClass2*>()
                .ctor<yourClass>()
                .func("say", &yourClass::say)
                .func<std::string, const char*>("fly", &yourClass::fly)
                .closure<yourClass*, yourClass, int, yourClass2*>("runMyLambda", [&](int n, yourClass2* ptr) -> yourClass* {
                    return new yourClass(n, ptr);
                });
            // now 'tbridger<yourClass>' contains 5 bridge funcs in static memory.

            scope& managedFuncs = tbridger<yourClass>::subs(); // usage-way 1)

            str derivedBaseObj = tbridger<yourClass>::make(new yourClass(0, nullptr)); // usage-way 2)
            derivedBaseObj->isSub<baseObj>() // true.
            str res = derivedBaseObj->run("say", narr{nInt(23)});
            res->cast<nint>(); // 24

            str arg2 = tbridger<yourClass2>::ctor().make(new yourClass2());
            str res = derivedBaseObj->run("runMyLambda", narr{nInt(0), *args2})
            // res is new tbridge<yourClass> instance.
        ```

* origin object has been added.
    origin shouldn't be visible to most places. so when you pass, handle origin object,
    you treat it just as a baseObj. there is no specific API which is only available
    to origin class, not baseObj.

* fix minor memory leak issues.

* add reldbg build mode.
    it's code has been optimized out just like rel mode, but still includes debug info.

* logging readability improved.
    1. mostly NM_TAG value was redundant. so removed.
    add some padding to align values.

    2. when AST structure display, prints pointer address by representing 4 hex digit.

    3. on verification, prints what it verifies, step by step.

* code refactoring to get better class structure.
    * make defVarExpr to reduce code duplication between defPropExpr and defAssignExpr.

    * remove code duplication between whileExpr, forExpr.

    * delete redundant classes.

    * add 'worker' as common class of 'verifier, interpreter, visitor, parser, preEvaluator, starter'.

* add new frame API

* signal catch.
    * when system interrupt raised, it can be catched to our signaler class.
    * before crash app, prints all current running AST structure.

* exception handling.
    * when unexpected 'err' instance found on running one of statements in blockExpr, it'll be judged to an exception.
    * when exception found, leave to errReport, codes keep unwinding. and finally app will stop its doing if there is proper
      handling logic somewhere.
    * native call stack can be shown.

* enhanced graphVisitor
    * show more text in color.
    * show more info to debug and know in detail.
    * show each node's address in 4 hex digit. very useful when you debug.

* performance optimization
    * add 'mockNode'
    this is literally doesn't contains copied object info but have only origin object info.
    but when this mockNode placed on verification, verifier regards that this is something cloned by origin object.
    so it think this as complete object. and that's what I want.
    in consequences, I don't copy each nodes and member variables for verification.

* new syntax, 'break'.

* new syntax, 'overloading'.
    function overloading is now functional.
    when you call a function and it could be one of possible functions in your context,
    verification will calculate affinity of each possible calls and score it.
    I named it as 'match'.
    each match represents function-call against all available functions in current frame.
    there are 4 kind of matches now.

        EXACT_MATCH:        this means perfect score match. this is probably what user wants.
        NUMERIC_MATCH:      to call this function, some of user's parameter should numeric
                            implicit cast. numeric implicit cast has slightly high priority to
                            usual cast.
        IMPLICIT_MATCH:     to call this func, some of user's paremeter should usual cast.
                            mostly, it would be upcasting. (e.g. DerivedClass --> SuperClass)
        NO_MATCH:           with implicit casting, there is no way to be enough to call this func.
                            explicit casting may required.

    and each match also has calling score(== lv). the lower the higher priority.
    each score can easily be calculated. it's how far distance does it to top of the current frame.

* new syntax, ': ;'.
    it's inline empty block.

* remove old syntax, 'elif'
    use 'else if' instead.

Dust is the name of an update used by the 'Node Engine' project that was origin of the 'world language'.
'NodeEngine' is a result of consideration how to visualize programming elements and let users express and orgranize their thoughts in visual. Unfortunately, as a result of deliberation, I had to accept not to release to public because it's not enough useful to what I intended to be.

it has been developed by myself for quite a while, so even if it's not released officially I want to keep it below as records.
